# Chorelito AI â€” Expo Scaffold

This is a minimal Expo + TypeScript starter aligned with your v2 spec.
- Pastel theme tokens in `app/styles/*`
- Voice module stubs in `app/lib/voice/*` (uses `react-native-voice` + `expo-speech`)
- Soft enforcement overlay in `app/child/overlay/*`
- Firebase Functions scaffold in `functions/`

## Quick start
1) `npm i -g expo` (if needed)
2) `npm i`
3) `npm run start`

For voice on device, you'll likely use **Expo Dev Client** to load `react-native-voice`.
