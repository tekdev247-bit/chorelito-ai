# Chorelito AI (v2) — Starter Pack

Trade chores for screen time — fully automated, with voice control and a playful, pastel UI.

## What's inside
- `README.md` (this file) — brief overview
- `cursor-spec.json` — build plan for Cursor
- `app/styles/*` — tokens, theme, colors
- `app/lib/voice/*` — voice rules and session hook
- `app/child/overlay/*` — lock overlay (soft enforcement)
- `app/lib/policy/*` — usage policy and time request client API
- `functions/src/*` — Firebase Functions stubs

Use this pack to bootstrap the project in Cursor. See `cursor-spec.json` for objectives, scaffolding commands, file purposes, and acceptance criteria.

## Color scheme (Pastel, playful, parent-friendly)
- Primary Sky Blue `#63B3ED`
- Coral Peach `#FF8C82`
- Mint Green `#8EE3C2`
- Soft Lavender `#C3B5F5`
- Backgrounds Off-white `#FFFDF9`, Light Sky `#E8F7FF`

## Notes
- These files are minimal and compile-oriented; expand per spec.
- Functions use TypeScript-style pseudocode; integrate with Firebase project setup.
